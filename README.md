# Labs Assesment - 500 Word Essay

* This README.md file contains a list of what is included in this reposiroty, I have also talked about the importance of code readability, importance of code maintainability and I have listed a couple of refrences which I have used in this file to support me with writing about readbility and maintainability.

* In this Repository I have included 3 Labs.py files and 4 README.md files including this one which I will give a brief explination about here:

1. Scientific_Calculator > Lab3.py - Python file with a fully coded calculator.

2. Scientific_Calculator > README.md - Markdown file which includes information about the Lab3.py, how it works and where to locate the file.

3. Soduku > Lab5.py - Python file with a fully coded Soduku game.

4. Soduku > README.md - Markdown file which includes information about the Lab5.py, how it works and where to locate the file.

5. Task_Manager > Lab6.py - Python file with a fully coded task management system.

6. Task_Manager > README.md - Markdown file which includes information about the Lab6.py, how it works and where to locate the file. 

## Importance of code readability

Code readability is really important as not only is it good to have easily readable code for yourself and other users who read your code, it makes it more understandable and it is really good for the maintainability as it helps with reducing bugs and it also introduces an ability to become more of an effective developer for the future. Companies are more likely going to hire a developer with readable code compared to a developer who has a poor readability of their programming. It allows modifications to be really easy as you are able to point out specific parts of the code and already understand what it does, this means that your able to edit the code with a lesser chance of breaking it further down the line as already understand how the block of code your modifying works. It is really easy to have a high readability of code and it starts with having clear and correct names for functions, procedures, paramaters, vairables and classes. Such as for a function if you name it "addTask()" you can already interpret what the function will do compared to naming it "function1()" as you wont know what that function does without reading it properly or running the code which is time consuming and with coding generally time is of the essence. Another element of having readable code is having high consistancy of formatting the code such as indentation and spacing and having comments on the code to allow you and other developers to be able to read and understand the code easilly for modification and learning purposes. If the code is within a logcal flow it means that everything is in order which the code runs so that you are able to to debug the code and easilly locate where the issue is as everything flows in an orderly manner.

## Importance of code maintainability

Code maintainability is a highly crucial and critical aspect of software development. Code maintainability is about how easily programs can be undertood, appended and changed by yourself or other developers. It is about easy it is to manage and update the code to keep it indate and running smoothly as all extensions, libraries and IDEs are updated regulary so the code will need to be updated to ensure that it still runs perfectly. Code Maintainability is very important as firstly it saves time. With a fully maintained project developers like yourself and others are able to improve the featues or even create their own without struggle. If a program is well maintained it means that the project will have less issues, bugs and glitches which will allow all users who use it to have the best experience whilst using the program. This also means that if support with the program is needed, it wont take long for any collaberators to understand the code so they can assist you and contribute to the help of the program, again without wasting valuable time. The best way to maintain the code is buy breaking down all tasks into sub tasks and this is by using functions, procedures and paramaters as you are able to seperate the code and break it down into smaller tasks. This will allow easier testing as you can run each function at a time without having to compile the whole code. If there are colaberators, each one can work on a specific sub task to find an overall solution to the main task. It also allows the sub tasks to be updated without the whole entire code having to be updated at the same time. Testing with sub tasks wont break the whole code, it will just have errors for the sub task which is being worked on. Making use of these modules allows other developers to easily understand the code as they can see how each sub task contributes to the solution of the main task.

## Conclusion
Overall I have come to the conclusion that code maintainabillity and code readability are very similar and significantly important. This is because a code has to be readable and easily understandable for yourself and other developers who contribute to the code as they will save so much time being able to understand each variable and nameable function within the code. With a program having a high readability level it means that it can also be easily maintained due to good formatting, comments and documentation throughout the code so it means that everyone can understand the code correctly and fix any errors or bugs to make sure that is fully functional and maintained.
