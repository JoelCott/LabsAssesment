# LabsAssesment - Lab 6  Task Manager

### Lab Location
* LabAssessment > Task_Manager > Lab6.py

### Lab Overview
* In this project I have created a task manager. In this you are able to store specific tasks in specific days of the week or months of the year. This program makes use of dictionaries and lists to store the data. The days and months are the keys in the to access the data stored in the lists to then remove or append to it. I will discuss the functions used below.
1. addTask_Day - This adds a specific task to the day you chose once prompted.
2. addTask_Month - Adds a task to the month you chose once prompted.
3. removeTask_Day - Clears a specific task from the day of your choice.
4. removeTask_Month - Removes a specific task from the month of your choice.
5. viewTask_Day - Views all the tasks in the day of your choice.
6. viewTask_Month - Views all the tasks in the month of your choice.

### How to download the repository and run the program
1. Download Visual Studio Code or an IDE of your choice. (Visual Studio code it recomended as you can easilly open a GitHub repository.)
2. Log in / Sign up to GitHub (https://github.com/login)
3. Open up the repository, copy the link and then open it with visual studio code by doing the following:
    1. Open Source Control > Clone Github Repository
    2. Paste the link in the top menu which opens up
    3. Select the link you've pasted
    4. Click enter and then wait, it will load up shortly after you have followed these steps.
    5. You will then be able to view the 3 labs projects which have been uploaded. You will then get access to the README.md files, Source code and the user interfance once you have ran the code.

### How to use the Task Manager
Firstly, once you have accessed the code click F5 or Run > Run with Debugging and then the user interface will show and it is highly user friendly and easy to operate. Once you have loaded the program the user interface will then ask you to select an option:
1. Add a task
2. Remove a task
3. View a task
4. Quit the program
* Once you have chosen an option you will then need to tell the program if you would like to use one of those actions on either the days of the week or months of the year. After that you must enter a task of your choice to be appended into the system. The program will keep repeating until you tell it to quit once prompted. The prompt will appear after every action you take.
