# LabsAssesment - Lab 3 Scientific Calulcator 

## Lab Location
* LabAssessment > Scientific_Calculator > Lab3.py

### Lab Overview
* In this project I have created a scientific calculator. You are able to make use of multiple functions which a normal calulcator would allow you to perform:
1. Addition - Adding 2 or more numbers together and outputting the result.
2. Subtraction - Taking away 2 or more numbers away from eachother and outputting the result.
3. Multiplication - Finding the sum of 2 or more inputs and outputting the result.
4. Division - Collecting 2 or more numbers and dividing them all from eachother and outputting the result. There is data validation is the user tries to divide by 0.
5. Exponential - Collecting 1 number and finding out its exponential and outputting it to the user.
6. Square root - Collecting 1 or more number(s) from the list and finding out all their square roots then outputting it to the user.
7. Trigonometry - Fetching the 1 number from the list and working out the sin, cos and tan values from the entered angle then outputting it to the user.
8. Logarithmic - Collecting 1 number and calculating the its logarithm and then outputting it to the user.

### How to download the repository and run the program
1. Download Visual Studio Code or an IDE of your choice. (Visual Studio code it recomended as you can easilly open a GitHub repository.)
2. Log in / Sign up to GitHub (https://github.com/login)
3. Open up the repository, copy the link and then open it with visual studio code by doing the following:
    1. Open Source Control > Clone Github Repository
    2. Paste the link in the top menu which opens up
    3. Select the link you've pasted
    4. Click enter and then wait, it will load up shortly after you have followed these steps.
    5. You will then be able to view the 3 labs projects which have been uploaded. You will then get access to the README.md files, Source code and the user interfance once you have ran the code.

### How to use the calculator
Firstly, once you have accessed the code click F5 or Run > Run with Debugging and then the user interface will show and it is highly user friendly and easy to operate. You will be asked to enter the amount of numbers you would like to use in the calculator and then you will be asked to enter a number depending on how many numbers you said you would like to input. After that it will store those numbers in a one dimentional array and then you will be given the option to choose one of the functions shown in the lab overview section. After making your decision, the code will simply take the numbers out of the list, calculate the answer based on the function you choose, return the new value into the array and then output it back to you. The program will repeat until you tell it to stop once prompted.
